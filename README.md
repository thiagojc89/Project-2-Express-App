Tom is a cool guy, he lived in Chicago his whole life. Since he was a kid his parents always had pets at home, and Tom was always surrounded by dogs and cats all over the house.
Tom also had a dream to become a pilot and after a lot of suffering he got his license which is fantastic good news, but unfortunately, he would not be able to be at home to play with his dogs.

So one day Tom decided to put an end on his suffer, and come up with this idea to create a web site when he would be able to see all dogs close to him and so he could contact the owners and make a proposal to them to play, walk, have fun with his pets. And this is the primary idea to his site.
